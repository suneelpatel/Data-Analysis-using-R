# 1. About Data Analystics
**Data Analytics** is the science of examining raw data with the purpose of drawing conclusions about that information. It is all about discovering useful information from the data to support decision-making. This process involves inspecting, cleansing, transforming & modeling data.

Data analystics refers to the techniques to analyes data to enchance productivity and business gain.

**Definition**: Data Analysis is a process of inspecting, cleaning, transforming, and modeling data with the goal of discovering useful information, suggesting conclusions, and supporting decision-making.

#### What does a Data Analyst do?
**Data analysts translate numbers into plain English.** Every business collects data, like sales figures, market research, logistics, or transportation costs. A data analyst’s job is to take that data and use it to help companies to make better business decisions.

#### Why is Data Analytics important?
As an enormous amount of data gets generated, the need to extract useful insights is a must for a business enterprise. Data Analytics has a key role in improving your business. Here are 4 main factors which signify the need for Data Analytics:

* **Gather Hidden Insights** – Hidden insights from data are gathered and then analyzed with respect to business requirements.
* **Generate Reports** – Reports are generated from the data and are passed on to the respective teams and individuals to deal with further actions for a high rise in business.
* **Perform Market Analysis** – Market Analysis can be performed to understand the strengths and the weaknesses of competitors.
* **Improve Business Requirement** – Analysis of Data allows improving Business to customer requirements and experience.

# 2. ETL (Extract, Transform and Load)
ETL is defined as a process that extracts the data from different RDBMS source systems or other data sources, then transforms the data (like applying calculations, concatenations, etc.) and finally loads the data into the Data Warehouse system. ETL full-form is Extract, Transform and Load.

It's tempting to think a creating a Data warehouse is simply extracting data from multiple sources and loading into database of a Data warehouse. This is far from the truth and requires a complex ETL process. The ETL process requires active inputs from various stakeholders including developers, analysts, testers, top executives and is technically challenging.

### Why do you need ETL?
There are many reasons for adopting ETL in the organization:

* It helps companies to analyze their business data for taking critical business decisions.
* Transactional databases cannot answer complex business questions that can be answered by ETL.
* A Data Warehouse provides a common data repository
* ETL provides a method of moving the data from various sources into a data warehouse.
* As data sources change, the Data Warehouse will automatically update.
* Well-designed and documented ETL system is almost essential to the success of a Data Warehouse project.
* Allow verification of data transformation, aggregation and calculations rules.
* ETL process allows sample data comparison between the source and the target system.
* ETL process can perform complex transformations and requires the extra area to store the data.
* ETL helps to Migrate data into a Data Warehouse. Convert to the various formats and types to adhere to one consistent system.
* ETL is a predefined process for accessing and manipulating source data into the target database.
* ETL offers deep historical context for the business.
* It helps to improve productivity because it codifies and reuses without a need for technical skills.

### Extract – 
Data extraction involves extracting data from homogeneous or heterogeneous sources;

#### Three Data Extraction methods:

* Full Extraction
* Partial Extraction- without update notification.
* Partial Extraction- with update notification

#### Some validations are done during Extraction:

* Reconcile records with the source data
* Make sure that no spam/unwanted data loaded
* Data type check
* Remove all types of duplicate/fragmented data
* Check whether all the keys are in place or not

### Transform – 
Data transformation processes data by data cleansing and transforming them into a proper storage format/structure

#### Validations are done during this stage

* Filtering – Select only certain columns to load
* Using rules and lookup tables for Data standardization
* Character Set Conversion and encoding handling
* Conversion of Units of Measurements like Date Time Conversion, currency conversions, numerical conversions, etc.
* Data threshold validation check. For example, age cannot be more than two digits.
* Data flow validation from the staging area to the intermediate tables.
* Required fields should not be left blank.
* Cleaning ( for example, mapping NULL to 0 or Gender Male to "M" and Female to "F" etc.)
* Split a column into multiples and merging multiple columns into a single column.
* Transposing rows and columns,
* Use lookups to merge data
* Using any complex data validation (e.g., if the first two columns in a row are empty then it automatically reject the row from processing)

### Load – 
Data loading describes the insertion of data into the final target database

#### Types of Loading:

* Initial Load — populating all the Data Warehouse tables
* Incremental Load — applying ongoing changes as when needed periodically.
* Full Refresh —erasing the contents of one or more tables and reloading with fresh data.

#### Load verification
* Ensure that the key field data is neither missing nor null.
* Test modeling views based on the target tables.
* Check that combined values and calculated measures.
* Data checks in dimension table as well as history table.
* Check the BI reports on the loaded fact and dimension table.

#### Key Points of ETL:
* ETL is an abbreviation of Extract, Transform and Load.
* ETL provides a method of moving the data from various sources into a data warehouse.
* In the first step extraction, data is extracted from the source system into the staging area.
* In the transformation step, the data extracted from source is cleansed and transformed .
* Loading data into the target datawarehouse is the last step of the ETL process.

# 3. Data Manipulation in R
The process of changing data to make it more orgazined and easy to read is known as Data Manipulation.

Before we discuss data manipulation in depth we need to understand **data wrangling or data munging** first.

#### Data Wrangling (Data Munging):
Data Wrangling is the process of converting and mapping data from its raw form to another format with the purpose of making it more valuable and appropriate for advance tasks such as Data Analytics and Machine Learning.

Data wrangling, like most data analytics processes, is an iterative one – the practitioner will need to carry out these steps repeatedly in order to produce the results he desires. There are six broad steps to data wrangling, which are:

##### 1. Discovering
In this step, the data is to be understood more deeply. Before implementing methods to clean it, you will definitely need to have a better idea about what the data is about. Wrangling needs to be done in specific manners, based on some criteria which could demarcate and divide the data accordingly – these are identified in this step.

##### 2. Structuring
Raw data is given to you in a haphazard manner, in most cases – there will not be any structure to it. This needs to be rectified, and the data needs to be restructured in a manner that better suits the analytical method used. Based on the criteria identified in the first step, the data will need to be separated for ease of use. One column may become two, or rows may be split – whatever needs to be done for better analysis.

##### 3. Cleaning
The process of detecting and correcting corrupt or inaccurate records from database or dataset is said to be data cleaning.

All datasets are sure to have some outliers, which can skew the results of the analysis. These will have to be cleaned, for the best results. In this step, the data is cleaned thoroughly for high-quality analysis. Null values will have to be changed, and the formatting will be standardized in order to make the data of higher quality.

Inconsistent and noisy data cannot be used to gain meaningful insights in an organisation. The noisy data needs to be cleaned before it is used for analytical approaches.

##### 4. Enriching
After cleaning, it will have to be enriched – this is done in the fourth step. This means that you will have to take stock of what is in the data and strategise whether you will have to augment it using some additional data in order to make it better. You should also brainstorm about whether you can derive any new data from the existing clean data set that you have.

##### 5. Validating
Validation rules refer to some repetitive programming steps which are used to verify the consistency, quality and the security of the data you have. For example, you will have to ascertain whether the fields in the data set are accurate via a check across the data, or see whether the attributes are normally distributed.

##### 6. Publishing
The prepared wrangled data is published so that it can be used further down the line – that is its purpose after all. If needed, you will also have to document the steps which were taken or logic used to wrangle the said data.

#### Tidy Data:
##### Tidy data is a standard way of mapping the meaning of a dataset to its structure.

In tidy data:
* 1. Each variable forms a column.
* 2. Each observation forms a row.
* 3. Each type of observational unit forms a table.

#### Impute Missing Values

Imputing relates to applying a model to restore missing values.

There are several options users can consider while replacing a missing value, for example:

* A fixed value that has meaning within the domain, such as 0, distinct from all other values.
* A value from another randomly chosen from the record.
* A mean, median or mode value replaced for the column.
* A value determined by another predictive model.

Any imputing conducted on the training dataset will have to be performed on new data in the future when predictions are required from the finalized model. This needs to be taken into factor when choosing how to impute the missing values.

For example, if one chooses to impute with mean column values, the mean column values will need to be stored to file for later exercise new data that has missing values.

# 4. EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
**EDA or Exploratory Data Analysis** is the brainstorming stage of Machine Learning. It is a very important step which takes place after feature engineering and acquiring data and it should be done before any modeling. It's very important for a data scientist to be able to understand the nature of the data without making assumptions.

The purpose of EDA is to use summary statistics and visualizations to better understand data, and find clues about the tendencies (the patterns and trends in the data) of the data, its quality and to formulate assumptions and the hypothesis of our analysis. At this stage, all the useful insights are drawn and correlations between the variables are understood.

For example, in the case of predicting rainfall, we know that there is a strong possibility of rain if the temperature has fallen low. Such correlations must be understood and mapped at this stage.

**EDA or Exploratory Data Analysis** is an approach for summarizing, visualizing, and becoming intimately familiar with the important characteristics of a data set.

It is an approach/philosophy for data analysis that employs a variety of techniques (mostly graphical) to maximize insight into a data set;
* uncover underlying structure;
* extract important variables;
* detect outliers and anomalies;
* test underlying assumptions;
* develop parsimonious models; and
* determine optimal factor settings.

### Value of Exploratory Data Analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis is valuable to data science projects since it allows to get closer to the certainty that the future results will be valid, correctly interpreted, and applicable to the desired business contexts. Such level of certainty can be achieved only after raw data is validated and checked for anomalies, ensuring that the data set was collected without errors. EDA also helps to find insights that were not evident or worth investigating to business stakeholders and data scientists but can be very informative about a particular business.

EDA is performed in order to define and refine the selection of feature variables that will be used for machine learning. Once data scientists become familiar with the data set, they often have to return to feature engineering step, since the initial features may turn out not to be serving their intended purpose. Once the EDA stage is complete, data scientists get a firm feature set they need for supervised and unsupervised machine learning.

### Methods of Exploratory Data Analysis
It is always better to explore each data set using multiple exploratory techniques and compare the results. Once the data set is fully understood, it is quite possible that data scientist will have to go back to data collection and cleansing phases in order to transform the data set according to the desired business outcomes. The goal of this step is to become confident that the data set is ready to be used in a machine learning algorithm.

Exploratory Data Analysis is majorly performed using the following methods:
* **Univariate Visualization** — provides summary statistics for each field in the raw data set
* **Bivariate Visualization** — is performed to find the relationship between each variable in the dataset and the target variable of interest
* **Multivariate Visualization** — is performed to understand interactions between different fields in the dataset
* **Dimensionality Reduction** — helps to understand the fields in the data that account for the most variance between observations and allow for the processing of a reduced volume of data.

Through these methods, the data scientist validates assumptions and identifies patterns that will allow for the understanding of the problem and model selection and validates that the data has been generated in the way it was expected to. So, value distribution of each field is checked, a number of missing values is defined, and the possible ways of replacing them are found.

### Additional benefits Exploratory Data Analysis brings to projects

Another side benefit of EDA is that it allows to specify or even define the questions you are trying to get the answer to from your data. Companies, that are only starting to leverage Data Science and AI technologies, often face the situation when they realize, that they have a lot of data and no ideas of what value that data can bring to their business decision making.
However, the questions always come first in data analysis. It doesn’t matter how much data company has, how many tools they have available, whether the data is historical or real time unless business stakeholders have the questions they are trying to solve with their data. EDA can help such companies to start formalizing the right questions, since with wrong questions you get the wrong answers, and take the wrong decisions.

### Why skipping Exploratory Data Analysis is a bad idea
In a hurry to get to the machine learning stage or simply impress business stakeholders very fast, data scientists tend to either entirely skip the exploratory process or do a very shallow work. It is a very serious and, sadly, common mistake of amateur data science consulting “professionals”.

Such inconsiderate behavior can lead to skewed data, with outliers and too many missing values and, therefore, some sad outcomes for the project:
* generating inaccurate models;
* generating accurate models on the wrong data;
* choosing the wrong variables for the model;
* inefficient use of the resources, including the rebuilding of the model.

It is a classical and under-utilized approach that helps you quickly build a relationship with the new data.

It is always better to explore each data set using multiple exploratory techniques and compare the results. The goal of this step is to understand the dataset, identify the missing values & outliers if any using visual and quantitative methods to get a sense of the story it tells. It suggests the next logical steps, questions or areas of research for your project.

# 5. Statistics Essentials for Analytics
### What is statistics?
Statistics Definition: (Science of Average and their Estimate)
Statistics is the science of collecting, organizing, presenting, analyzing and interpreting data for specific purpose to help in making more effective decision.

#### Why study statistics:
To make more effective decision for the betterment of individual, society, business, nature and so on

#### Statistical Analysis:

Statistical analysis is implemented to manipulate, summarize, and investigate data, so that useful decision making information results are obtained.

##### Two type of statistics:

1. Descriptive Statistics (used to describe the basic features of the data)

2. Inferential statistics (aims at learning characteristics of the population from a sample)

### 1. Data and its Types
#### What is data?
Data is a set of collected or recorded facts of particular subject.

Data in general terms refer to facts and statistics collected together for reference or analysis.

Types of Data:
#### 1. Qualitative Data
#### 2. Quantitative Data 

#### 1. Qualitative Data:
“Data Associated with the quality in different categories”. Data is measurements, each fall into one of several categories. (Hair Color, ethnic groups and other attributes of the population)

##### (a). Nominal Data: “With no inherent order or ranking”
~ Data with no inherent order or ranking such as gender or race, suck kind of data called Nominal Data.

##### (b). Ordinal Data: “with an order series”

#### 2. Quantitative Data: 
“Data associated with Quantity which can be measured”
~ Data measured on a numeric scale (distance travelled to college, the number of children in a family etc.)

##### (a). Discrete Data: “Based on count, finite number of values possible and value cannot be subdivided”
~ Data which can be categorized into classification, data which is based upon counts, there are only a finite number of values possible and values cannot be subdivided meaningfully, such kind of data is called Discrete Data.

##### (b). # Continuous Data: “measured on a continuum or a scale, value which can be subdivided into finer increments”
~ Data which can be measured on a continuum or a scale, data which can be have almost any numeric value and can be subdivided into finer and finer increments, such kind of data is called Continuous Data.

### 2. Variable and it's Types
#### What is variable?
A variable in algebra represents an unknown value or a value that varies.

#### Types of Variables:
##### 1. Categorical Variable:
Variable that can be put into categories. For example, male and female are two categories in a Gender.

##### 2. Control Variable:
A factor in an experiment which must be held constant

##### 3. Confounding Variable:
Extra variables that have a hidden effects on your experimental results

##### 4. Dependent Variable (Output Variable):
The outcome of an experiment

##### 5. Independent Variable (Input Variable):
A variable that is not affected by anything


### 3. Sample and Population
#### Population:
A Population is the set of all possible states of a random variable. The size of the population may be either infinite or finite.

In other words, A collection or set of individual or objects or events whose properties are to be anlysed called population.

#### Sample:
A Sample is a subset of the population; its size is always finite.

A subset of population is called "Sample". A well choosen sample will contain most of the information about a particular population parameter.


### 4. Sampling Techniques

#### 1. Probability Sampling : 
This Sampling technique uses randomization to make sure that every element of the population gets an equal chance to be part of the selected sample. It’s alternatively known as random sampling.

##### (a) Random Sampling : 
Every element has an equal chance of getting selected to be the part sample. It is used when we don’t have any kind of prior information about the target population.

For example: Random selection of 20 students from class of 50 student. Each student has equal chance of getting selected. Here probability of selection is 1/50.

##### (b) Systematic Sampling 

Here the selection of elements is systematic and not random except the first element. Elements of a sample are chosen at regular intervals of population. All the elements are put together in a sequence first where each element has the equal chance of being selected.

For a sample of size n, we divide our population of size N into subgroups of k elements.

We select our first element randomly from the first subgroup of k elements.

To select other elements of sample, perform following:

We know number of elements in each group is k i.e N/n

So if our first element is n1 then

Second element is n1+k i.e n2

Third element n2+k i.e n3 and so on..

Taking an example of N=20, n=5

No of elements in each of the subgroups is N/n i.e 20/5 =4= k

Now, randomly select first element from the first subgroup.

If we select n1= 3

n2 = n1+k = 3+4 = 7

n3 = n2+k = 7+4 = 11


##### (c) Stratified Sampling 
This technique divides the elements of the population into small subgroups (strata) based on the similarity in such a way that the elements within the group are homogeneous and heterogeneous among the other subgroups formed. And then the elements are randomly selected from each of these strata. We need to have prior information about the population to create subgroups.

#### 2. Non-Probability Sampling : 
It does not rely on randomization. This technique is more reliant on the researcher’s ability to select elements for a sample. Outcome of sampling might be biased and makes difficult for all the elements of population to be part of the sample equally. This type of sampling is also known as non-random sampling.

##### (a) Snowball Sampling:
This technique is used in the situations where the population is completely unknown and rare.
Therefore we will take the help from the first element which we select for the population and ask him to recommend other elements who will fit the description of the sample needed.

So this referral technique goes on, increasing the size of population like a snowball.

##### For example: 
It’s used in situations of highly sensitive topics like HIV Aids where people will not openly discuss and participate in surveys to share information about HIV Aids.

Not all the victims will respond to the questions asked so researchers can contact people they know or volunteers to get in touch with the victims and collect information

Helps in situations where we do not have the access to sufficient people with the characteristics we are seeking. It starts with finding people to study.

##### (b) Quota Sampling: 
This type of sampling depends of some pre-set standard. It selects the representative sample from the population. Proportion of characteristics/ trait in sample should be same as population. Elements are selected until exact proportions of certain types of data is obtained or sufficient data in different categories is collected.

##### For example: 
If our population has 45% females and 55% males then our sample should reflect the same percentage of males and females.

##### (c) Judgement sampling 
This is based on the intention or the purpose of study. Only those elements will be selected from the population which suits the best for the purpose of our study.

##### For Example: 
If we want to understand the thought process of the people who are interested in pursuing master’s degree then the selection criteria would be “Are you interested for Masters in..?”

All the people who respond with a “No” will be excluded from our sample.

##### (d) Convenience Sampling
Here the samples are selected based on the availability. This method is used when the availability of sample is rare and also costly. So based on the convenience samples are selected.

##### For example: 
Researchers prefer this during the initial stages of survey research, as it’s quick and easy to deliver results.

### Descriptive Statistics:
Descriptive Statistics uses the data to provide descriptions of the population, either through numerical calculation or graph or tables.
