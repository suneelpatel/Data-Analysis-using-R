# 1. About Data Analystics
**Data Analytics** is the science of examining raw data with the purpose of drawing conclusions about that information. It is all about discovering useful information from the data to support decision-making. This process involves inspecting, cleansing, transforming & modeling data.

Data analystics refers to the techniques to analyes data to enchance productivity and business gain.

**Definition**: Data Analysis is a process of inspecting, cleaning, transforming, and modeling data with the goal of discovering useful information, suggesting conclusions, and supporting decision-making.

#### What does a Data Analyst do?
**Data analysts translate numbers into plain English.** Every business collects data, like sales figures, market research, logistics, or transportation costs. A data analyst’s job is to take that data and use it to help companies to make better business decisions.


# 2. ETL (Extract, Transform and Load)
ETL is defined as a process that extracts the data from different RDBMS source systems or other data sources, then transforms the data (like applying calculations, concatenations, etc.) and finally loads the data into the Data Warehouse system. ETL full-form is Extract, Transform and Load.

It's tempting to think a creating a Data warehouse is simply extracting data from multiple sources and loading into database of a Data warehouse. This is far from the truth and requires a complex ETL process. The ETL process requires active inputs from various stakeholders including developers, analysts, testers, top executives and is technically challenging.

### Why do you need ETL?
There are many reasons for adopting ETL in the organization:

* It helps companies to analyze their business data for taking critical business decisions.
* Transactional databases cannot answer complex business questions that can be answered by ETL.
* A Data Warehouse provides a common data repository
* ETL provides a method of moving the data from various sources into a data warehouse.
* As data sources change, the Data Warehouse will automatically update.
* Well-designed and documented ETL system is almost essential to the success of a Data Warehouse project.
* Allow verification of data transformation, aggregation and calculations rules.
* ETL process allows sample data comparison between the source and the target system.
* ETL process can perform complex transformations and requires the extra area to store the data.
* ETL helps to Migrate data into a Data Warehouse. Convert to the various formats and types to adhere to one consistent system.
* ETL is a predefined process for accessing and manipulating source data into the target database.
* ETL offers deep historical context for the business.
* It helps to improve productivity because it codifies and reuses without a need for technical skills.

### Extract – 
Data extraction involves extracting data from homogeneous or heterogeneous sources;

#### Three Data Extraction methods:

* Full Extraction
* Partial Extraction- without update notification.
* Partial Extraction- with update notification

#### Some validations are done during Extraction:

* Reconcile records with the source data
* Make sure that no spam/unwanted data loaded
* Data type check
* Remove all types of duplicate/fragmented data
* Check whether all the keys are in place or not

### Transform – 
Data transformation processes data by data cleansing and transforming them into a proper storage format/structure

#### Validations are done during this stage

* Filtering – Select only certain columns to load
* Using rules and lookup tables for Data standardization
* Character Set Conversion and encoding handling
* Conversion of Units of Measurements like Date Time Conversion, currency conversions, numerical conversions, etc.
* Data threshold validation check. For example, age cannot be more than two digits.
* Data flow validation from the staging area to the intermediate tables.
* Required fields should not be left blank.
* Cleaning ( for example, mapping NULL to 0 or Gender Male to "M" and Female to "F" etc.)
* Split a column into multiples and merging multiple columns into a single column.
* Transposing rows and columns,
* Use lookups to merge data
* Using any complex data validation (e.g., if the first two columns in a row are empty then it automatically reject the row from processing)

**Load** – 
Data loading describes the insertion of data into the final target database

#### Types of Loading:

* Initial Load — populating all the Data Warehouse tables
* Incremental Load — applying ongoing changes as when needed periodically.
* Full Refresh —erasing the contents of one or more tables and reloading with fresh data.

#### Load verification
* Ensure that the key field data is neither missing nor null.
* Test modeling views based on the target tables.
* Check that combined values and calculated measures.
* Data checks in dimension table as well as history table.
* Check the BI reports on the loaded fact and dimension table.

#### Key Points of ETL:
* ETL is an abbreviation of Extract, Transform and Load.
* ETL provides a method of moving the data from various sources into a data warehouse.
* In the first step extraction, data is extracted from the source system into the staging area.
* In the transformation step, the data extracted from source is cleansed and transformed .
* Loading data into the target datawarehouse is the last step of the ETL process.
